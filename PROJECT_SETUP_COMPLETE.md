## üìù Next Steps

### 1. Apply Metadata to Issues (Manual or Script)

You can either:

**Option A: Use the GitHub UI**
- Visit https://github.com/orgs/stokedconsulting/projects/5
- Click on each issue and set the fields according to `scripts/update-issue-metadata.md`

**Option B: Wait for Phase 1 implementation**
- Once we implement the GitHub Projects API client, we can programmatically set all metadata

### Recommended Initial Metadata (Phase 1)

Set these for the Phase 1 issues to get started:

**Issues #1-8 (Phase 1 - Ready to work)**
- Status: Ready
- Priority: High (#1-6), Medium (#7-8)
- Sprint: Sprint 1
- Issue Type: Epic (#1), Feature (#2-8)
- Area: Projects (#1-4, #6-8), Core (#5)
- Size: L (#1), M (#2-4, #6), S (#5, #7-8)

**Issue #15 (Master Tracking)**
- Status: In Progress
- Priority: Critical
- Issue Type: Epic
- Area: Projects

**Issues #9-14 (Future Phases)**
- Status: Todo
- Blocked By: #1 (for #9-14)
- Sprint: Sprint 2 (#9-10, #13-14), Sprint 3 (#11-12)

### 2. Configure autonomous to Use the Project

Once metadata is set, you can configure autonomous:

```bash
# Copy example config
cp .autonomous-config.example.json .autonomous-config.json

# Edit and set your GitHub token
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_token_here"

# The project section is already configured for Project #5
```

### 3. Start Using autonomous

Once configured, you can:

```bash
# See project status
autonomous project status

# List ready items
autonomous project list-ready

# Start working (will pick highest priority Ready item)
autonomous start
```

Note: The `project` commands don't exist yet - they'll be created in Phase 1!

## üéØ Current Sprint 1 Scope

These issues are ready to be worked on:

1. **#2** - Implement GitHubProjectsAPI (8h, High, M)
2. **#3** - Add project field mapping (6h, High, M)
3. **#4** - Implement project items query (8h, High, M)
4. **#5** - Add project configuration (4h, High, S)
5. **#6** - Create 'project init' command (6h, High, M)
6. **#7** - Create 'project status' command (4h, Medium, S)
7. **#8** - Create 'project list-ready' command (4h, Medium, S)

**Total Sprint 1**: 40 hours of work

## üöÄ Ready to Start Phase 1!

The project is fully configured and ready for Phase 1 implementation to begin.

**Next command to run:**
```bash
# Once Phase 1 is complete, this will work:
autonomous start
# ‚Üí Will automatically pick issue #2 (highest priority in Sprint 1)
```
